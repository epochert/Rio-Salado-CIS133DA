    <h2> The Horizon Leans </h2>
    <p>Maya Angelou</p>
    <p><strong>The horizon leans forward,</strong><br>
        <!--The text above is the title of the poem and is very famous and has high importance and seriousness-->
        Offering you space to place new steps of change.<br>
        Here, on the pulse of this fine day<br>
        You may have the courage<br>
        To look up and out upon me, the<br>
        Rock, the River, the Tree, your country.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        No less to Midas than the mendicant.<br>
        No less to you now than the mastodon then.<br>
    </p>
    Here on the pulse of this new day<br>
    You may have the grace to look up and out<br>
    And into your sister’s eyes, into<br>
    Your brother’s face, your country<br>
    And say simply<br>
    Very simply<br>
    With hope<br>
    Good morning.<br>
